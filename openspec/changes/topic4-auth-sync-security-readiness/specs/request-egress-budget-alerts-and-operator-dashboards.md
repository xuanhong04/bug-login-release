# Request/Egress Budget Alerts and Operator Dashboards

**Change ID:** topic4-auth-sync-security-readiness  
**Phase:** 5.3 (P1)

## Goal
Detect cost anomalies early and give operators actionable controls.

## Alert Dimensions
- Sync request count spikes.
- Egress volume spikes.
- Error-rate increase causing retry storms.
- Tenant/profile outlier behavior.

## Alert Policy
- Warning alerts at configurable thresholds.
- Critical alerts when hard budget boundary is approached/exceeded.
- Alert deduplication and cooldown to avoid noise.

## Dashboard Requirements
- Time-series trends by tenant/profile/container class.
- Top cost contributors and failure hotspots.
- Drill-down from team to profile and device level.

## Minimum Acceptance
- Operators can detect and identify runaway cost source before billing cycle end.
- Alerts include remediation hints (reduce optional sync, pause profile, adjust quota).
- Alert and operator actions are audit logged.

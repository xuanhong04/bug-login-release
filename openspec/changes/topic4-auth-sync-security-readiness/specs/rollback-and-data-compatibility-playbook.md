# Rollback and Data Compatibility Playbook

**Change ID:** topic4-auth-sync-security-readiness  
**Phase:** 6.3 (P0)

## Goal
Allow safe rollback without data corruption or irreversible schema mismatch.

## Rollback Principles
- Backward-compatible data schema migration where possible.
- Versioned manifests for sync payload and local vault metadata.
- No destructive migration without validated rollback path.

## Playbook Steps
1. Detect release regression and trigger rollback decision.
2. Freeze risky write paths if data compatibility risk is high.
3. Roll back feature flags first, then service/client versions if needed.
4. Run compatibility checks on persisted/synced artifacts.
5. Resume normal traffic only after integrity checks pass.

## Minimum Acceptance
- Rollback can be executed in bounded operational time.
- No orphaned or unreadable profile data after rollback.
- Rollback timeline and actions are auditable.

# Implementation Tasks: Topic 4 - Auth, Sync, Security, and Release Readiness

**Change ID:** topic4-auth-sync-security-readiness

## Phase 0: Priority Ladder (P0-P4)
- [x] 0.1 Define P0-P4 operational case matrix (baseline/escalation/deferred/exception) (completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] 0.2 Define release escalation rules for P0 invariant violations (completed 2026-03-19)

Quality Gate:
- [x] Every auth/sync/team request can be mapped to one P0-P4 row (completed 2026-03-19)

## Phase 1: Data and Security Contracts (P0)
- [x] 1.1 Data classification matrix (public/sensitive/secret/runtime) (completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] 1.2 Local encryption architecture and key lifecycle (create/rotate/recover) (completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] 1.3 Secret handling policy (no plaintext logs/config leak) (completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] 1.4 Threat model and trust boundary doc (completed 2026-03-19)

Quality Gate:
- [x] Every persisted datum has explicit storage/encryption policy (completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] Failure/recovery paths are documented for key and token errors (completed 2026-03-19)

## Phase 2: Session Continuity and Sync Semantics (P0)
- [x] 2.1 Runtime contract (Running/Parked/Stopped/Crashed/Terminating) (spec completed 2026-03-19; partial implementation completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] 2.2 Stop semantics: default stop behavior + force terminate path (spec completed 2026-03-19; partial implementation completed 2026-03-19)
- [x] 2.3 Selective sync policy by container (must/optional/never) (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 2.4 Commit points and close-safe UX guarantees (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 2.5 Conflict and stale-state handling across devices (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)

Quality Gate:
- [ ] No silent loss of cookies/session/tabs in supported flows
- [ ] Sync state is deterministic and user-visible

## Phase 3: Auth Readiness (KMedia) (P0)
- [x] 3.1 KMedia token exchange contract (entry token -> app sessions) (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 3.2 Device session lifecycle (access/refresh/revoke/list) (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 3.3 Re-auth fallback and degraded mode policy (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 3.4 Dev bypass mode for ongoing app development (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)

Quality Gate:
- [ ] Session revoke and token expiry behavior is testable and deterministic
- [ ] Dev mode and prod mode can be switched by config without code changes

## Phase 4: Team Governance (P1)
- [x] 4.1 Role matrix (owner/admin/member/viewer) and backend enforcement (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 4.2 Share/move/group ownership rules and transfer semantics (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 4.3 Profile lock + heartbeat + stale lock recovery + takeover policy (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 4.4 Offboarding flow (revoke, release locks, transfer ownership) (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 4.5 Audit trail taxonomy and event coverage (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)

Quality Gate:
- [ ] Every protected action has a permission check and audit event
- [ ] Offboarding can be executed without orphaned profile ownership

## Phase 5: Cost and Scale Controls (P1)
- [x] 5.1 Profile/team quota model (soft/hard limits) (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 5.2 Pre-sync size estimation and large-sync warnings (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 5.3 Request/egress budget alerts and operator dashboards (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 5.4 Lifecycle cleanup policy for stale/volatile artifacts (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)

Quality Gate:
- [ ] Cost runaway can be detected and controlled before billing spikes

## Phase 6: Release and Rollout (P0)
- [x] 6.1 Release gate checklist (functional/security/reliability) (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 6.2 Canary + feature flags for staged activation (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 6.3 Rollback and data compatibility playbook (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)
- [x] 6.4 Cross-platform smoke and regression matrix signoff (spec completed 2026-03-19; implementation pending)

Quality Gate:
- [ ] Candidate can be rolled out and rolled back safely
- [ ] Cross-platform profile core flows pass without blocker defects

# Proposal: Topic 2 - Browser Profile Parity and Release Readiness

**Change ID:** `topic2-browser-profile-parity-and-release-readiness`
**Created:** 2026-03-18
**Status:** Spec Locked (Phase 1 complete)

---

## Problem Statement
BugLogin needs a release-ready Browser Profile experience that can replace HideMyAcc-class tools without regression in core daily flows. Current direction is clear, but parity criteria, release gates, and phased scope are not yet locked in OpenSpec.

Without a locked Topic 2 spec:
- parity targets stay ambiguous across product, UX, and engineering
- "ready to replace now" cannot be measured consistently
- cross-platform readiness (Windows/macOS/Linux) may drift by team or phase

## Proposed Solution
Define Topic 2 as a parity-first release program focused on Browser Profile operations, with HideMyAcc as primary benchmark and GoLogin as secondary reference:
- lock end-to-end Browser Profile flow requirements
- lock UI/UX flow and interaction logic requirements
- lock team/role business rules with Kmediaz access direction noted
- lock cross-platform reliability and release gates
- define gap matrix workflow to prioritize Must match, Must better, and Later

## Scope

### In Scope
- Browser Profile lifecycle flow (create, configure, run, manage, recover)
- UI/UX flow quality for high-frequency profile tasks
- UI/UX logic for defaults, validation, feedback, and recovery
- team access and role behavior for solo + team operation
- release gate criteria for "replace now" quality bar
- parity gap matrix and phase planning

### Out of Scope (for this spec phase)
- deep automation ecosystem parity
- billing/commercial model implementation
- live Kmediaz integration implementation (direction only)
- non-profile specialized tooling unrelated to core replacement goal

## Impact Analysis

| Component | Change Required | Details |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Frontend UI | Yes | Profile flows, list operations, loading/error/retry consistency |
| Tauri Backend | Yes | Reliability, run-state correctness, proxy/profile lifecycle support |
| Role/Access Layer | Yes | Team access semantics and auditability baseline |
| QA/Release | Yes | Gate matrix, smoke/regression definitions across 3 OS |
| Docs/Planning | Yes | Competitive matrix, phase goals, acceptance checklist |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Browser Profile core flows are explicitly specified and acceptance-testable.
- [ ] Topic 2 parity matrix is categorized into Must match / Must better / Later.
- [ ] Release gates define measurable "replace now" readiness.
- [ ] Cross-platform reliability expectations are explicit for Windows/macOS/Linux.
- [ ] Team/role behavior is defined for solo + team usage.
- [ ] Kmediaz dependency is captured as integration direction, not immediate blocker.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Scope inflation from broad competitor comparison | High | High | Freeze Topic 2 around Browser Profile core and release gates |
| Parity claims without measurable proof | Medium | High | Enforce gate metrics and repeatable QA scenarios |
| Cross-platform inconsistencies near release | Medium | High | Define OS-specific smoke matrix early in tasks |
| Over-focusing on feature count vs experience quality | Medium | Medium | Require UX flow and logic gates, not only feature checklists |

## Decision Lock (Confirmed)

1. Benchmark priority: HideMyAcc-first, GoLogin-secondary.
2. Target users: solo and team.
3. Platform target: Windows + macOS + Linux.
4. Main scope: Browser Profile flow, UI/UX flow, UI/UX logic, business behavior, core function parity.
5. Automation-heavy parity is not part of Topic 2 acceptance.

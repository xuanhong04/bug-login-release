# Implementation Tasks: Topic 2 - Browser Profile Parity and Release Readiness

**Change ID:** `topic2-browser-profile-parity-and-release-readiness`

---

## Phase 1: Competitive Baseline and Gap Lock

- [x] 1.1 Finalize comparative baseline (HideMyAcc primary, GoLogin secondary) for Browser Profile core flows - 2026-03-18
- [x] 1.2 Populate gap matrix with Must match / Must better / Later - 2026-03-18
- [x] 1.3 Lock replacement definition and release gate metrics - 2026-03-18

**Quality Gate:**
- [x] No ambiguous parity item remains in Must match scope - 2026-03-18
- [x] Release-readiness checklist is measurable and testable - 2026-03-18

## Phase 2: Browser Profile Flow Parity

- [x] 2.1 Align create/edit/clone/archive/restore profile lifecycle flow - 2026-03-19
- [x] 2.2 Align run/stop state transitions with deterministic status feedback - 2026-03-19
- [x] 2.3 Align proxy setup + proxy validation + retry workflow - 2026-03-19
- [x] 2.4 Align list operations (search/filter/group/tag/sort/pin) for high-frequency usage - 2026-03-19

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] Core profile tasks can be completed without dead-end states
- [ ] Run/proxy failures provide clear recovery path

---

## Phase 3: UI/UX Flow and Logic Hardening

- [x] 3.1 Reduce friction in "create + proxy + run" golden path - 2026-03-19
- [x] 3.2 Standardize loading/empty/error/success states in profile workflows - 2026-03-19
- [x] 3.3 Improve defaults, validation, and guardrails for safer operations - 2026-03-19
- [x] 3.4 Ensure async actions always expose progress and disable unsafe duplicate submit - 2026-03-19

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] UX flow metrics meet target thresholds in QA matrix
- [ ] No unhandled async interaction in profile core flows

---

## Phase 4: Team Access and Kmediaz Direction Fit

- [x] 4.1 Define role behavior baseline (owner/admin/member/viewer) - 2026-03-19
- [x] 4.2 Define permission scope for profile/group/workspace actions - 2026-03-19
- [x] 4.3 Define audit events required for core actions - 2026-03-19
- [x] 4.4 Document Kmediaz access-management integration direction and interface boundaries - 2026-03-19

**Quality Gate:**
- [x] Role boundaries are explicit and testable - 2026-03-19
- [x] Kmediaz direction is documented without blocking Topic 2 execution - 2026-03-19

---

## Phase 5: Cross-Platform Reliability and Release Readiness

- [x] 5.1 Define smoke suite for Windows/macOS/Linux profile core workflows - 2026-03-19
- [x] 5.2 Define regression loop and pass criteria - 2026-03-19
- [x] 5.3 Lock replacement release gate ("can replace now") with final checklist - 2026-03-19

**Quality Gate:**
- [ ] No blocker crash in smoke suite for core flow
- [ ] Replacement checklist is complete and signed off

---

## Completion Checklist

- [x] OpenSpec proposal/tasks/spec deltas finalized - 2026-03-18
- [x] Superpowers spec/plan synced with OpenSpec scope - 2026-03-18
- [x] Bead tracking item active with file linkage - 2026-03-18
- [x] Ready to enter implementation planning phase - 2026-03-18

# Delta: Team Access Baseline and Kmediaz Direction

**Change ID:** `topic2-browser-profile-parity-and-release-readiness`
**Affects:** roles, permissions, auditability, access-direction alignment

---

## ADDED

### Requirement: Solo and Team Compatibility
Product MUST support both solo and team operation without branching into separate product behavior.

#### Scenario: Workspace mode usage
- GIVEN either a solo operator or team workspace
- WHEN managing Browser Profiles
- THEN flow semantics remain consistent and role-appropriate

### Requirement: Role and Permission Baseline
Role behavior MUST be explicit for owner/admin/member/viewer over profile/group/workspace actions.

#### Scenario: Permission-sensitive action
- GIVEN a user role and a protected action
- WHEN action is attempted
- THEN authorization behavior is deterministic and auditable

### Requirement: Kmediaz Access Direction Notes
Topic 2 MUST capture Kmediaz-based access management direction and boundary interfaces without blocking parity implementation.

#### Scenario: Future access integration kickoff
- GIVEN Kmediaz integration becomes implementation-ready
- WHEN engineering starts integration
- THEN documented boundaries reduce refactor risk in Topic 2 core flows

## MODIFIED

### Requirement: Access Clarity in UX
Permission limitations should be visible and understandable in the UI.

#### Scenario: User lacks permission
- GIVEN an unauthorized action attempt
- WHEN UI responds
- THEN denial reason and next step are clear

## REMOVED

- Assumption that role ambiguity is acceptable in replacement-grade release

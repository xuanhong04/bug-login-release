# Delta: Token-Ready License Posture

**Change ID:** `topic1-rebrand-and-ux-hardening`
**Affects:** commercial trial UX, gating posture, future integration readiness

---

## ADDED

### Requirement: Neutral Token-Ready UX
App MUST stay fully usable while presenting neutral token-ready posture for future integration.

#### Scenario: User opens app without token integration enabled
- GIVEN token integration is not yet implemented
- WHEN user uses app
- THEN no commercial-trial interruption blocks normal operation

### Requirement: Future Token Integration Notes
The codebase MUST retain clear implementation notes for future `kmediaz.com` token integration.

#### Scenario: Token system implementation starts
- GIVEN token backend is ready
- WHEN implementation begins
- THEN prepared notes/interfaces allow fast integration without refactoring unrelated UX

## MODIFIED

### Requirement: Trial Banner/Modal Behavior
Commercial trial banner/modal behavior should be removed from active UX.

#### Scenario: Trial status expired
- GIVEN previous trial logic exists
- WHEN app starts
- THEN user does not see disruptive trial-expired modal flow

## REMOVED

- User-facing commercial trial countdown and expiration interruption flows

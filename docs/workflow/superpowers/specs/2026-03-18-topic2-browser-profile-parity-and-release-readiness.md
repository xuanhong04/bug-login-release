# Topic 2 Design: Browser Profile Parity and Release Readiness

Date: 2026-03-18
Owner: codex
Status: in_progress
OpenSpec Change: `openspec/changes/topic2-browser-profile-parity-and-release-readiness`

## Objective
Define and execute a parity-first release blueprint so BugLogin can replace HideMyAcc-class tools for Browser Profile core usage across solo and team contexts on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Locked Decisions
1. Competitive priority is HideMyAcc-first and GoLogin-secondary.
2. Topic 2 scope is Browser Profile flow, UI/UX flow, UI/UX logic, business behavior, and core functional parity.
3. Automation-heavy parity is not required for Topic 2 acceptance.
4. Kmediaz is a direction dependency for access control, captured now as integration notes and boundary contracts only.
5. Replacement readiness is gate-driven and measured, not narrative.

## Scope
- Competitive benchmark and gap matrix for Browser Profile domain.
- Product flow parity for create/configure/run/manage/recover.
- UX flow and logic hardening (defaults, validation, feedback, recovery).
- Team/role baseline for solo + team operation.
- Cross-platform release gates and readiness criteria.

## Non-Goals
- Full automation stack parity.
- Commercial billing model rollout.
- Immediate Kmediaz API implementation.

## Acceptance Targets
- Topic 2 has complete OpenSpec proposal/tasks/spec deltas.
- Release gates define "can replace now" quality bar with measurable outcomes.
- Gap matrix is execution-ready with Must match / Must better / Later buckets.
- Planning artifacts are aligned between OpenSpec, Superpowers docs, and Beads.
